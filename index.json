The method is devised by using the discontinuous Galerkin approximation with a special choice of the numerical traces and a fully implicit time-stepping method for temporal discretization. The HDG method possesses several unique features which distinguish themselves from other discontinuous Galerkin methods. First, it reduces the globally coupled unknowns to the approximate trace of the velocity and the mean of the pressure on element boundaries, thereby leading to a significant reduction in the degrees of freedom. Second, it allows for pressure, vorticity and stress boundary conditions to be prescribed on different parts of the boundary. Third, it provides, for smooth viscous-dominated problems, approximations of the velocity, pressure, and velocity gradient which converge with the optimal order of k+1 in the L2 norm, when polynomials of degree k ? 0 are used for all components of the approximate solution.

The method is devised by using the discontinuous Galerkin approximation with a special choice of the numerical traces and a fully implicit time-stepping method for temporal discretization. The HDG method possesses several unique features which distinguish themselves from other discontinuous Galerkin methods. First, it reduces the globally coupled unknowns to the approximate trace of the velocity and the mean of the pressure on element boundaries, thereby leading to a significant reduction in the degrees of freedom. Second, it allows for pressure, vorticity and stress boundary conditions to be prescribed on different parts of the boundary. Third, it provides, for smooth viscous-dominated problems, approximations of the velocity, pressure, and velocity gradient which converge with the optimal order of k+1 in the L2 norm, when polynomials of degree k ? 0 are used for all components of the approximate solution.

Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the performance and convergence of the bounds for the HDG method in both uniform and adaptive mesh refinements.","tags":["hdg"],"title":"A posteriori goal-oriented bounds for the Poisson problem using potential and equilibrated flux reconstructions: Application to the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sebastien Boyaval","Claude Le Bris","Yvon Maday","Ngoc Cuong Nguyen","Anthony T Patera"],"categories":null,"content":"In this work, a Reduced Basis (RB) approach is used to solve a large number of boundary value problems parametrized by a stochastic input - expressed as a Karhunen?Loeve expansion ? in order to compute outputs that are smooth functionals of the random solution fields.

Conventional solvers for time-periodic flows are limited in accuracy and efficiency by the low-order Finite Volume and time-marching methods they typically employ. These methods introduce significant numerical dissipation in the simulated flow, and can require hundreds of timesteps to describe a periodic flow with only a few harmonic modes. However, recent developments in high-order methods and Fourier-based time discretizations present an opportunity to greatly improve computational performance. This thesis presents a novel Time-Spectral Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method for periodic flow problems, together with applications to flow through cascades and rotor/stator assemblies in aeronautical turbomachinery. The present work combines a Fourier-based Time-Spectral discretization in time with an HDG discretization in space, realizing the dual benefits of spectral accuracy in time and high-order accuracy in space. Low numerical dissipation and favorable stability properties are inherited from the high-order HDG method, together with a reduced number of globally coupled degrees of freedom compared to other DG methods. HDG provides a natural framework for treating boundary conditions, which is exploited in the development of a new high-order sliding mesh interface coupling technique for multiple-row turbomachinery problems. A regularization of the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model is also employed to ensure numerical stability of unsteady flow solutions obtained with high-order methods. Turning to the temporal discretization, the Time-Spectral method enables direct solution of a periodic flow state, bypasses initial transient behavior, and can often deliver substantial savings in computational cost compared to implicit time-marching. An important driver of computational efficiency is the ability to select and resolve only the most important frequencies of a periodic problem, such as the blade-passing frequencies in turbomachinery flows. To this end, the present work introduces an adaptive frequency selection technique, using the Time-Spectral residual to form an inexpensive error indicator. Having selected a set of frequencies, the accuracy of the Time-Spectral solution is greatly improved by using optimally selected collocation points in time. For multi-domain problems such as turbomachinery flows, an anti-aliasing filter is also needed to avoid errors in the transfer of the solution across the sliding interface. All of these aspects contribute to the Adaptive Time-Spectral HDG method developed in this thesis. Performance characteristics of the method are demonstrated through applications to periodic ordinary differential equations, a convection problem, laminar flow over a pitching airfoil, and turbulent flow through a range of single- and multiple-row turbomachinery configurations. For a 2:1 rotor/stator flow problem, the Adaptive Time-Spectral HDG method correctly identifies the relevant frequencies in each blade row. This leads to an accurate periodic flow solution with greatly reduced computational cost, when compared to sequentially selected frequencies or a time-marching solution. For comparable accuracy in prediction of rotor loading, the Adaptive Time- Spectral HDG method incurs 3 times lower computational cost (CPU time) than time-marching, and for prediction of only the 1st harmonic amplitude, these savings rise to a factor of 200. Finally, in three-row compressor flow simulations, a high-order HDG method is shown to achieve significantly greater accuracy than a lower-order method with the same computational cost. For example, considering error in the amplitude of the 1st harmonic mode of total rotor loading, a p = 1 computation results in 20% error, in contrast to only 1% error in a p = 4 solution with comparable cost. This highlights the benefits that can be obtained from higher-order methods in the context of turbomachinery flow problems\n","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"d0df9924238108c0486268a8794f9b89","permalink":"https://ngoccuongnguyen.github.io/project/cfd8/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cfd8/","section":"project","summary":"Numerical simulations of time-periodic flows are an essential design tool for a wide range of engineered systems, including jet engines, wind turbines and flapping wings.

We devise the method as follows. First, we express the approximate scalar variable and corresponding flux within each element in terms of an approximate trace of the scalar variable along the element boundary. We then define a unique value for the approximate trace by enforcing the continuity of the normal component of the flux across the element boundary; a global equation system solely in terms of the approximate trace is thus obtained. The high number of globally coupled degrees of freedom in the discontinuous Galerkin approximation is therefore significantly reduced. If the problem is time-dependent, we discretize the time derivative by means of backward difference formulae. This results in efficient schemes capable of producing high-order accurate solutions in space and time.

Prior work considers grounded electrode systems, of relevance for earthed towers, trees, or windmills subjected to thunderstorms fields. In this configuration, the effect of wind is to remove the shielding ions from the coronating electrode vicinity strengthening the corona and increasing its current. There are a number of cases, such as isolated wind turbine blades or airborne vehicles, that are not completely represented by the available models and experiments. This paper focuses on electrode systems that are electrically isolated from their environment and reports on a wind tunnel campaign and accompanying theoretical work.

Prior work considers grounded electrode systems, of relevance for earthed towers, trees, or windmills subjected to thunderstorms fields. In this configuration, the effect of wind is to remove the shielding ions from the coronating electrode vicinity strengthening the corona and increasing its current. There are a number of cases, such as isolated wind turbine blades or airborne vehicles, that are not completely represented by the available models and experiments. This paper focuses on electrode systems that are electrically isolated from their environment and reports on a wind tunnel campaign and accompanying theoretical work.

At the zeroth-order Fabry-Perot resonance condition, our coaxial apertures act as a ?zero-mode resonator (ZMR)?, efficiently funneling as much as 34 percent of incident infrared (IR) light along 10 nm annular gaps.

This article presents a computational method that relies on a degree-of-freedom reordering such that the HDG linear system accommodates an additional static condensation step to eliminate a large portion of the degrees of freedom of the approximate trace, thereby yielding a much smaller linear system. For the particular metallic structures considered in this article, the resulting linear system obtained by means of nested static condensations is a block tridiagonal system, which can be solved efficiently. We apply the nested HDG method to compute second harmonic generation on a triangular coaxial periodic nanogap structure.

The transmission conditions are based upon transferring the numerical flux from the first mesh to the second mesh and the numerical trace from the second mesh to the first one. The transfer of the numerical trace/flux from one mesh to the other relies on the extrapolation of the approximate flux, and is made to be consistent with the HDG methodology for conforming meshes.

The method is devised from a generalization of the complementary energy principle and the duality theory. Using duality theory, the computation of bounds is reduced to finding independent potential and equilibrated flux reconstructions. A generalization of this result is also introduced allowing to derive alternative guaranteed bounds from nearly-arbitrary H(div;?) flux reconstructions (only zero-order equilibration is required). This approach is applicable to any numerical method used to compute the solution. In this work, the proposed approach is applied to derive bounds for the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method. An attractive feature of the proposed approach is that superconvergence on the bound gap is achieved, yielding accurate bounds even for very coarse meshes.

The experiment models the first stage of aircraft-triggered lightning in which a positive leader typically develops from the vehicle and is shortly afterwards followed by a negative leader. This mechanism of lightning initiation amounts to around 90 percent of strikes to aircraft. Aircraft can acquire net charge levels of the order of a millicoulomb from a number of sources including corona emission, charged particles in the engine exhaust, and charge transfer by collisions with particles in the atmosphere. In addition, aircraft could potentially be artificially charged through controlled charge emission from the surface. Experiments were performed on a model aircraft with a 1m wingspan, which was suspended between two parallel electrodes in a 1.45m gap with voltage difference of a few hundred kilovolts applied across it. In this configuration, it is found that the breakdown field can vary by as much as 30 percent for the range of charging levels tested. The experimental results show agreement with an electrostatic model of leader initiation from aircraft, and the model indicates that the effect can be substantially stronger if additional negative charge is added to the aircraft. The results from this work suggest that flying uncharged is not optimal in terms of lightning avoidance and open up the possibility of developing risk-reduction strategies based on net charge control.","tags":[],"title":"Aircraft Charging and its Influence on Triggered Lightning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carmen Guerra-Garcia","Pol Fontanes","Michele Urbani","Joan Montanya","Theodore Mouratidis","Manuel Martinez-Sanchez","Ngoc Cuong Nguyen"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

The charging system consists on an onboard d.c. high voltage power supply (of the order of 10 kV) with the high voltage terminal connected to a coronating anode and the low voltage terminal connected to the body whose potential needs to be controlled. The system must be electrically floating and exposed to wind. During an initial transient, the positive ions produced by the corona are convected away by the wind and the body charges negatively in response. This paper presents a theoretical model of the charging strategy that reveals two distinct regimes of charging and corona operation, as well as wind tunnel experiments using both a sphere-corona tip assembly and a 2D wing-corona wire assembly that confirm the theoretical predictions. Finally, we implement the system in an RC aircraft to demonstrate that charging in flight using corona discharge is feasible and does not affect flight operations.","tags":[],"title":"Controlled Electric Charging of an Aircraft in Flight using Corona Discharge","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

Prior work considers grounded electrode systems, of relevance for earthed towers, trees, or windmills subjected to thunderstorms fields. In this configuration, the effect of wind is to remove the shielding ions from the coronating electrode vicinity strengthening the corona and increasing its current. There are a number of cases, such as isolated wind turbine blades or airborne vehicles, that are not completely represented by the available models and experiments. This paper focuses on electrode systems that are electrically isolated from their environment and reports on a wind tunnel campaign and accompanying theoretical work. In this configuration, there are two competing effects the removal of the shielding ions by the wind, strengthening the corona, and the electrode system charging negatively for positive corona with respect to its environment, weakening the corona. This leads to three different operating regimes, namely, for positions that favor ion recapture, charging is limited and current increases with wind as in the classical scaling, for positions that favor ion transport by the wind, the system charges negatively and the current decreases with wind, for the later configuration, as wind increases, the current can vanish and the system potential saturates. The results from this work demonstrate that classical scaling laws of corona discharge in wind do not necessarily apply for isolated electrodes and illustrate the feasibility of using a glow corona in wind for controlled charging of a floating body.","tags":[],"title":"Corona Discharge in Wind for Electrically Isolated Electrodes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastien Terrana","Ngoc Cuong Nguyen","Jaime Peraire"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

The HDG methods are fully implicit, high-order accurate and endowed with a unique feature which distinguishes themselves from other discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. In particular, they reduce the globally coupled unknowns to the approximate trace of the solution on element boundaries, thereby resulting in considerably smaller global degrees of freedom than other DG methods. Furthermore, we develop a shock capturing method to deal with shocks by appropriately adding artificial bulk viscosity, molecular viscosity, thermal conductivity, and electric resistivity to the physical viscosities in the MHD equations. We show the optimal convergence of the HDG methods for ideal MHD problems and validate our resistive implementation for a magnetic reconnection problem. For smooth problems, we observe that employing a generalized Lagrange multiplier (GLM) formulation can reduce the errors in the divergence of the magnetic field by two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the robustness of our shock capturing method on a number of test cases and compare our results, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with other MHD solvers. For shock problems, we observe that an effective treatment of both the shock wave and the divergence-free constraint is crucial to ensuring numerical stability.","tags":"FearuredResearch","title":"Implicit hybridized discontinuous Galerkin methods for compressible magnetohydrodynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ferran Vidal-Codina","Luis Martin-Moreno","Cristian Ciraci","Daehan Yoo","Ngoc Cuong Nguyen","Sang-Hyun Oh","Jaime Peraire"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

A PDE model of a physical problem is typically described by conservation laws, constitutive laws, material properties, boundary conditions, boundary data, and geometry. In most practical applications, however, the PDE model is only an approximation to the real physical problem due to both (i) the deliberate mathematical simplification of the model to keep it tractable and (ii) the inherent uncertainty of the physical parameters. In such cases, the PDE model may not produce a good prediction of the true state of the underlying physical problem. In this paper, we introduce a functional regression method that incorporates observations into a deterministic linear PDE model to improve its prediction of the true state. Our method is devised as follows. First, we augment the PDE model with a random Gaussian functional which serves to represent various sources of uncertainty in the model. We next derive a linear regression model for the Gaussian functional by utilizing observations and adjoint states. This allows us to determine the posterior distribution of the Gaussian functional and the posterior distribution for our estimate of the true state. Furthermore, we consider the problem of experimental design in this setting, wherein we develop an algorithm for designing experiments to efficiently reduce the variance of our state estimate. We provide several examples from the heat conduction, the convection-diffusion equation, and the reduced wave equation, all of which demonstrate the performance of the proposed methodology.","tags":[],"title":"Terahertz and infrared nonlocality and field saturation in extreme-scale nanoslits","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587945600,"objectID":"3002c1f2bf301361b1eae1ab7f6762b9","permalink":"https://ngoccuongnguyen.github.io/project/afom/","publishdate":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/afom/","section":"project","summary":"We develop new computational methods and new theoretical analysis for important classes of large-scale simulation and soptimization problems arising in a variety of areas in engineering, science, data science, and applied mathematics. Towards this goal, we will develop and analyze new classes of principled first-order methods (FOMs) that are adapted to deal with the lack of smoothness of the objective function and/or the feasible domain. FOMs are appealing in several ways, as they need only work with gradients, they enjoy reasonably fast convergence, and they scale well in problem dimensions. These features make them suitable for truly large-scale applications, where the objective function is a sum (or average) of a huge number of component functions and the dimension of the optimization variable is huge. However, many existing state-of-the-art FOMs suffer from much slower convergence for a wide range of non-smooth problems. Indeed, without the smoothness condition, traditional FOMs and their accelerated versions do not converge either theoretically or empirically. The development of FOMs with improved and guaranteed convergence rates for solving non-smooth problems will not only advance theory but also broaden the scope of applicability of FOMs to important applications. The proposed research aims to discover new curvature or other mathematical structure conditions (beyond the smoothness condition traditionally required by FOMs) and accordingly, develop new first-order methods (or frameworks) for these conditions. We aim to establish rigorous convergence results to theoretically analyze the methods we will develop for non-smooth optimization problems. Finally, we apply our developed algorithms to solve very large-scale optimization problems in application areas both traditional and new. We will demonstrate the usefulness of our optimization algorithms on novel large-scale applications in the synergistic domains of medical imaging, quantum computing, molecular dynamics, and deep learning.

The simulation is performed using a matrix-free discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and a diagonally implicit Runge?Kutta scheme on graphics processor units. We propose a Jacobian-free Newton?Krylov method to solve nonlinear systems arising from the discretization of the Navier?Stokes equations. The method successfully predicts the buffet onset, the buffet frequency, and turbulence statistics owing to the high-order DG discretization and an efficient mesh refinement for the laminar and turbulent boundary layers. A number of physical phenomena present in the experiment are captured in our simulation, including periodical low-frequency oscillations of shock wave in the streamwise direction, strong shear layer detached from the shock wave due to shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction and small-scale structures broken down by the shear-layer instability in the transition region, and shock-induced flow separation. The pressure coefficient, the root mean square of the fluctuating pressure, and the streamwise range of the shock wave oscillation agree well with the experimental data. The results suggest that the proposed method can accurately predict the onset of turbulence and buffet phenomena at high Reynolds numbers without a subgrid scale model or a wall model.","tags":[],"title":"Wall-resolved implicit large eddy simulation of transonic buffet over the OAT15A airfoil using a discontinuous Galerkin method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

The HDG method is developed for a three-field formulation of nonlinear elasticity and is endowed with a number of attractive features that make it ideally suited for thin structures. Regarding robustness, the method avoids a variety of locking phenomena such as membrane locking, shear locking, and volumetric locking. Regarding accuracy, the method yields optimal convergence for the displacements, which can be further improved by an inexpensive postprocessing. And finally, regarding efficiency, the only globally coupled unknowns are the degrees of freedom of the numerical trace on the interior faces, resulting in substantial savings in computational time and memory storage. This last feature is particularly advantageous for thin structures because the number of interior faces is typically small. In addition, we discuss the implementation of the HDG method with arc-length algorithms for phenomena such as snap-through, where the standard load incrementation algorithm becomes unstable. Numerical results are presented to verify the convergence and demonstrate the performance of the HDG method through simple analytical and popular benchmark problems in the literature.","tags":[],"title":"A hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for both thin and 3D nonlinear elastic structures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

These collective excitations lead to resonances that enable the confinement of light in deep-subwavelength regions, thereby leading to large near-field enhancements. The simulation of plasmon resonances presents notable challenges. From the modeling perspective, the realistic behavior of conduction-band electrons in metallic nanostructures is not captured by Maxwell's equations, thus requiring additional modeling. From the simulation perspective, the disparity in length scales stemming from the extreme field localization demands efficient and accurate numerical methods. In this paper, we develop the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to solve Maxwell's equations augmented with the hydrodynamic model for the conduction-band electrons in noble metals. This method enables the efficient simulation of plasmonic nanostructures while accounting for the nonlocal interactions between electrons and the incident light. We introduce a novel postprocessing scheme to recover superconvergent solutions and demonstrate the convergence of the proposed HDG method for the simulation of a 2D gold nanowire and a 3D periodic annular nanogap structure. The results of the hydrodynamic model are compared to those of a simplified local response model, showing that differences between them can be significant at the nanoscale.","tags":[],"title":"A hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for computing nonlocal electromagnetic effects in three-dimensional metallic nanostructures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Fernandez","Ngoc Cuong Nguyen","Jaime Peraire"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

Because positive leaders are initiated and can propagate in lower fields than negative leaders, in general, a positive leader would occur first. During propagation of the positive leader, initiation of the negative leader is favored through the removal of positive charge from the aircraft. Based on this well-accepted bidirectional leader theory, we propose hindering the initiation of the positive leader by charging the aircraft to a negative level, selected to ensure that a negative leader will not form. Although not observed so far, a negative leader could be initiated first if the field enhancement at the negative end were much greater than at the positive end. In this situation, the biasing of the aircraft should be to positive levels. More generally, we propose that the optimum level of aircraft charging is that which makes both leaders equally unlikely. We present a theoretical study of the effectiveness of the strategy for an ellipsoidal fuselage as well as the geometry of a Falcon aircraft.

These resonances can lead to large enhancements of the incident field and to the confinement of light to small regions, typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the incident wavelength. The accurate prediction of these resonances entails several challenges. Small geometric variations in the plasmonic structure may lead to large variations in the electromagnetic field responses. Furthermore, the material parameters that characterize the optical behavior of metals at the nanoscale need to be determined experimentally and are consequently subject to measurement errors. It then becomes essential that any predictive tool for the simulation and design of plasmonic structures accounts for fabrication tolerances and measurement uncertainties. In this paper, we develop a reduced order modeling framework that is capable of real-time accurate electromagnetic responses of plasmonic nanogap structures for a wide range of geometry and material parameters. The main ingredients of the proposed method are (i) the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method to numerically solve the equations governing electromagnetic wave propagation in dielectric and metallic media, (ii) a reference domain formulation of the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations to account for arbitrary geometry variations; and (iii) proper orthogonal decomposition and empirical interpolation techniques to construct an efficient reduced model.

Numerous experimental studies of corona discharges in wind have confirmed the strong influence of wind on the corona current. Many of these studies report global electrical characteristics of the gaseous discharge but do not present details of the spatial structure of the potential field and charge distribution. Numerical simulation can help clarify the role of wind on the ion redistribution and the electric field shielding. In this work, we propose a methodology to solve numerically for the drift region of a DC glow corona using the usual approach of collapsing the ionization region to the electrode surface, but allowing for strong inhomogeneities in the electrical and flow setup. Numerical results for a grounded wire in the presence of an ambient electric field and wind are presented. The model predicts that the effect of the wind is to reduce the extension of the corona over the wire and to shift the center of the ion distribution upstream of the flow. In addition, we find that, even though the near-surface ion distribution is strongly affected by the ion injection law used, the current characteristics and the far field solution remain pretty much unaffected.","tags":[],"title":"Computational study of glow corona discharge in wind: Biased conductor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

Too coarse meshes can result in inaccurate predictions and in some cases lead to numerical instabilities, whereas too fine meshes produce accurate predictions at the expense of long simulation times. Constructing an optimal (or near-optimal) boundary-layer mesh has been recognized as an important problem in computational fluid dynamics. For few simple flows, one may be able to construct such a mesh a priori before simulation. For most viscous flow simulations, however, it is difficult to generate such mesh in advance. In this paper, a boundary-layer adaptivity method is developed for the efficient computation of steady viscous flows. This method turns the problem of determining the location of the mesh nodes into a set of equations that are solved simultaneously with the flow equations. The mesh equations are designed so that the boundary-layer mesh adapts to the viscous layers as the flow solver marches toward the converged solution. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance of the method.","tags":[],"title":"Mesh Topology Preserving Boundary-Layer Adaptivity Method for Steady Viscous Flows","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Fernandez","Ngoc Cuong Nguyen","Jaime Peraire"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

This paper aims to shed some light on this matter. To that end, we investigate the role of the Riemann solver, the SGS model, the time resolution, and the accuracy order in the ability to predict a variety of flow regimes, including transition to turbulence, wall-free turbulence, wall-bounded turbulence, and turbulence decay. The transitional flow over the Eppler 387 wing, the TaylorGreen vortex problem and the turbulent channel flow are considered to this end. The focus is placed on post-processing the LES results and providing with a rationale for the performance of the various approaches.","tags":[],"title":"Subgrid-scale modeling and implicit numerical dissipation in DG-based Large-Eddy Simulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

The method is fully explicit, high-order accurate in both space and time, and coincides with the classic discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with upwinding fluxes for a particular choice of its stabilization function. This means that it has the same computational complexity as other explicit DG methods. However, just as its implicit version, it provides optimal convergence of order for all the approximate variables including the gradient of the solution, and, when the time-stepping method is of order , it displays a superconvergence property which allow us, by means of local postprocessing, to obtain new improved approximations of the scalar field variables at any time levels for which an enhanced accuracy is required. In particular, the new approximations converge with order in the L2 norm for. These properties do not hold for all numerical fluxes. Indeed, our results show that, when the HDG numerical flux is replaced by the Lax?Friedrichs flux, the above-mentioned superconvergence properties are lost, although some are recovered when the Lax?Friedrichs flux is used only in the interior of the domain. Finally, we extend the explicit HDG method to treat the wave equation with perfectly matched layers.

During this process, the reattachment of the arc to new locations often occurs. The detailed description of this swept stroke is still at an early stage of research, and it entails the interaction between an electrical arc and the flow boundary layer. In this paper we examine the implications of the structure of the boundary layer for the arc sweeping and reattachment process by considering different velocity profiles, both for laminar and turbulent flow, as well as a high fidelity description, using large eddy simulation, of transitional flow over an airfoil. It is found that the local velocity fluctuations in a turbulent flow may be important contributors to the reattachment of the arc, through a combination of an increased potential drop along the arc and local approaches of the arc to the surface. Specific flow features, such as the presence of a laminar recirculation bubble, can also contribute to the possibility of reattachment.","tags":[],"title":"Arc reattachment driven by a turbulent boundary layer: implications for the sweeping of lightning arcs along aircraft","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Moro","Ngoc Cuong Nguyen","Jaime Peraire"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

A PDE model of a physical problem is typically described by conservation laws, constitutive laws, material properties, boundary conditions, boundary data, and geometry. In most practical applications, however, the PDE model is only an approximation to the real physical problem due to both (i) the deliberate mathematical simplification of the model to keep it tractable and (ii) the inherent uncertainty of the physical parameters. In such cases, the PDE model may not produce a good prediction of the true state of the underlying physical problem. In this paper, we introduce a functional regression method that incorporates observations into a deterministic linear PDE model to improve its prediction of the true state. Our method is devised as follows. First, we augment the PDE model with a random Gaussian functional which serves to represent various sources of uncertainty in the model. We next derive a linear regression model for the Gaussian functional by utilizing observations and adjoint states. This allows us to determine the posterior distribution of the Gaussian functional and the posterior distribution for our estimate of the true state. Furthermore, we consider the problem of experimental design in this setting, wherein we develop an algorithm for designing experiments to efficiently reduce the variance of our state estimate. We provide several examples from the heat conduction, the convection-diffusion equation, and the reduced wave equation, all of which demonstrate the performance of the proposed methodology.","tags":[],"title":"Functional Regression for State Prediction Using Linear PDE Models and Observations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ngoc Cuong Nguyen","J.

The essential ingredients are a local Galerkin projection of the underlying governing equations at the element level onto spaces of polynomials of degree k to parametrize the numerical solution in terms of the approximate trace, a judicious choice of the numerical flux to provide stability and consistency, and a global jump condition that weakly enforces the single-valuedness of the numerical flux to arrive at a global formulation in terms of the numerical trace. The EDG methods are thus obtained from the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method by requiring the approximate trace to belong to smaller approximation spaces than the one in the HDG method. In the EDG methods, the numerical trace is taken to be continuous on a suitable collection of faces, thus resulting in an even smaller number of globally coupled degrees of freedom than in the HDG method. On the other hand, the EDG methods are no longer locally conservative. In the framework of convection?diffusion problems, this lack of local conservativity is reflected in the fact that the EDG methods do not provide the optimal convergence of the approximate gradient or the superconvergence for the scalar variable for diffusion-dominated problems as the HDG method does. However, since the HDG method does not display these properties in the convection-dominated regime, the EDG method becomes a reasonable alternative since it produces smaller algebraic systems than the HDG method. In fact, the resulting stiffness matrix has a similar sparsity pattern as that of the statically condensed continuous Galerkin (CG) method. The main advantage of the EDG methods is that they are generally more stable and robust than the CG method for solving convection-dominated problems. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance of the EDG methods. They confirm that, even though the EDG methods are not locally conservative, they are a viable alternative to the HDG method in the convection-dominated regime.","tags":[],"title":"A class of embedded discontinuous Galerkin methods for computational fluid dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

We employ an advanced finite-element-modeling (FEM) technique, Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) scheme, for full three-dimensional modeling of the resonant transmission of THz waves through an annular gap that is 2 nm in width and 32 ?m in diameter. Our multiscale 3D FEM technique and atomic layer lithography will enable a series of new investigations in THz nanophotonics that has not been possible before.","tags":[],"title":"Nanogap-enhanced terahertz sensing of 1 nm thick lambda/106 dielectric films","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

Motivated by this observation, we present a modeling paradigm called ?fabrication-adaptive optimization? for treating issues of implementation/fabrication. We develop computationally focused theory and algorithms, and we present computational results for incorporating considerations of implementation/fabrication into constrained optimization problems that arise in photonic crystal design. The fabrication-adaptive optimization framework stems from the robust regularization of a function. When the feasible region is not a normed space (as typically encountered in application settings), the fabrication-adaptive optimization framework typically yields a nonconvex optimization problem. (In the special case where the feasible region is a finite-dimensional normed space, we show that fabrication-adaptive optimization can be recast as an instance of modern robust optimization.) We study a variety of problems with special structures on functions, feasible regions, and norms for which computation is tractable and develop an algorithmic scheme for solving these problems in spite of the challenges of nonconvexity. We apply our methodology to compute fabrication-adaptive designs of two-dimensional photonic crystals with a variety of prescribed features.","tags":[],"title":"Fabrication-Adaptive Optimization with an Application to Photonic Crystal Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["LNT Huynh","Ngoc Cuong Nguyen","J Peraire","BC Khoo"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

The HMDG method is developed upon extending the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method presented in [30].

Our local approximation spaces are characterized by two integers (n*, k*), where n* is the number of subcells within an element and k* is the polynomial degree of shape functions defined on the subcells. The selection of the value of (n*, k*) on a particular element depends on the smoothness of the solution on that element. More specifically, for elements on which the solution is smooth, we choose the smallest value n* = 1 and the highest degree k* = k. For elements containing shocks in the solution, we use the largest value n* = n and the lowest degree k* = 0 so as to capture shocks without using artificial viscosity and limiting slopes/fluxes. The proposed method thus combines the accuracy and efficiency of higli-order approximations with the robustness of low-order approximations.

The second HDG method does not explicitly enforce the divergence-free condition and thus results in a linear system for the degrees of freedom of the approximate trace of the tangential component of the vector field only. For both HDG methods, the approximate vector field converges with the optimal order of k + 1 in the L2-norm, when polynomials of degree k are used to represent all the approximate variables. We propose elementwise postprocessing to obtain a new Hcurl-conforming approximate vector field which converges with order k + 1 in the Hcurl-norm. We present extensive numerical examples to demonstrate and compare the performance of the HDG methods.","tags":[],"title":"Hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods for the time-harmonic Maxwells equations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Moro","Ngoc Cuong Nguyen","Jaime Peraire"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

Moreover, in order to render the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) tur- bulence model easier to integrate using HDG methods, we propose a simple modification of the SA model. The modification is effective only in regions where the eddy viscosity is smaller than the molecular viscosity. Therefore, it does not affect the numerical prediction of flow quantities as compared to the original SA model.

Applying the Newton?Raphson procedure and the hybridization technique, we obtain a global equation system solely in terms of the approximate trace of the scalar variable at every Newton iteration. The high number of globally coupled degrees of freedom in the discontinuous Galerkin approximation is therefore significantly reduced. We then extend the method to time-dependent problems by approximating the time derivative by means of backward difference formulae. When the time-marching method is p+1 order accurate and when polynomials of degree p are used to represent the scalar variable, each component of the flux and the approximate trace, we observe that the approximations for the scalar variable and the flux converge with the optimal order of p+1 in the L2 norm.

We devise the method as follows. First, we express the approximate scalar variable and corresponding flux within each element in terms of an approximate trace of the scalar variable along the element boundary. We then define a unique value for the approximate trace by enforcing the continuity of the normal component of the flux across the element boundary; a global equation system solely in terms of the approximate trace is thus obtained. The high number of globally coupled degrees of freedom in the discontinuous Galerkin approximation is therefore significantly reduced. If the problem is time-dependent, we discretize the time derivative by means of backward difference formulae. This results in efficient schemes capable of producing high-order accurate solutions in space and time. Indeed, when the time-marching method is th order accurate and when polynomials of degree *p* are used to represent the scalar variable, the flux and the approximate trace, we observe that the approximations for the scalar variable, the flux and the trace of the scalar variable converge with the optimal order of *p+1* in the L2 norm. Finally, we introduce a simple element-by-element postprocessing scheme to obtain new approximations of the flux and the scalar variable. The new approximate flux, which has a continuous inter-element normal component, is shown to converge with order *p+1*. The new approximate scalar variable is shown to converge with order *p+2*. For the time-dependent case, the postprocessing does not need to be applied at each time-step but only at the times for which an enhanced solution is required. Moreover, the postprocessing procedure is less expensive than the solution procedure, since it is performed at the element level. Extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence properties of the method.","tags":[],"title":"An implicit high-order hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for linear convection-diffusion equations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yvon Maday","Ngoc Cuong Nguyen","Anthony T.

The essential ingredients are a local Galerkin projection of the underlying PDEs at the element level onto spaces of polynomials of degree k to parametrize the numerical solution in terms of the numerical trace; a judicious choice of the numerical flux to provide stability and consistency; and a global jump condition that enforces the continuity of the numerical flux to arrive at a global weak formulation in terms of the numerical trace. The HDG methods are fully implicit, high-order accurate and endowed with several unique features which distinguish themselves from other discontinuous Galerkin methods. First, they reduce the globally coupled unknowns to the approximate trace of the solution on element boundaries, thereby leading to a significant reduction in the degrees of freedom. Second, they provide, for smooth viscous-dominated problems, approximations of all the variables which converge with the optimal order of k + 1 in the L2-norm. Third, they possess some superconvergence properties that allow us to define inexpensive element-by-element postprocessing procedures to compute a new approximate solution which may converge with higher order than the original solution. And fourth, they allow for a novel and systematic way for imposing boundary conditions for the total stress, viscous stress, vorticity and pressure which are not naturally associated with the weak formulation of the methods. In addition, they possess other interesting properties for specific problems. Their approximate solution can be postprocessed to yield an exactly divergence-free and H(div)-conforming velocity field for incompressible flows. They do not exhibit volumetric locking for nearly incompressible solids. We provide extensive numerical results to illustrate their distinct characteristics and compare their performance with that of continuous Galerkin methods.","tags":[],"title":"An efficient reduced-order modeling approach for non-linear parametrized partial differential equations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ngoc Cuong Nguyen","Anthony T.

Generally, the model term is only active at the edge of the boundary layer, where the grid resolution is insufficient to capture the abrupt change in curvature required for the eddy viscosity profile to match its free-stream value. Furthermore, the amount of viscosity required decreases with the grid resolution and vanishes when the resolution is sufficiently high. For transonic computations, an additional shock-capturing artificial viscosity model term is required.
