abstract = {We give a short overview of the development of the so-called hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin methods for hyperbolic problems. We describe the methods, discuss their main features and display numerical results which illustrate their performance. We do this in the framework of wave propagation problems. In particular, we show that these methods are amenable to static condensation, and hence to efficient implementation, both for time-dependent (with implicit time-marching schemes) and for time-harmonic problems; we also show that they can be used with explicit time-marching schemes. We discuss an unexpected, recently uncovered superconvergence property and introduce a new postprocessing for time-harmonic Maxwell's equations. We end by providing bibliographical notes.}
