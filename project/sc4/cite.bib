  title = {We present a class of reduced basis (RB) methods for the iterative solution of parametrized symmetric positive-definite (SPD) linear systems. The essential ingredients are a Galerkin projection of the underlying parametrized system onto a reduced basis space to obtain a reduced system; an adaptive greedy algorithm to efficiently determine sampling parameters and associated basis vectors; an offline-online computational procedure and a multi-fidelity approach to decouple the construction and application phases of the reduced basis method; and solution procedures to employ the reduced basis approximation as a stand-alone iterative solver or as a preconditioner in the conjugate gradient method. We present numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods in comparison with multigrid methods. Numerical results show that, when applied to solve linear systems resulting from discretizing the Poisson's equations, the speed of convergence of our methods matches or surpasses that of the multigrid-preconditioned conjugate gradient method, while their computational cost per iteration is significantly smaller providing a feasible alternative when the multigrid approach is out of reach due to timing or memory constraints for large systems. Moreover, numerical results verify that this new class of reduced basis methods, when applied as a stand-alone solver or as a preconditioner, is capable of achieving the accuracy at the level of the truth approximation which is far beyond the RB level.},
