abstract = { We present a wall-resolved implicit large eddy simulation (WRILES) of transonic buffet over the OAT15A supercritical airfoil at at Mach number 0.73, angle of attack \$3.5^{\rm o}\$ and Reynolds number \$3 \times 10^6\$. The simulation is performed using a high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and a diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) scheme on graphics processor units (GPUs). In order to effectively resolve the boundary layers at high Reynolds numbers, we develop a LES mesh refinement strategy to provide adequate resolution in the normal and streamwise/crossflow directions while keeping the aspect ratio of the elements below 20. Without yhe need for subgrid scale or wall models, the WRILES method successfully predicts the buffet onset, the buffet frequency, and turbulence statistics. Various turbulence phenomena are predicted and demonstrated, such as periodical low-frequency oscillations of shock wave in the streamwise direction, strong shear layer detached from the shock wave due to shock wave boundary layer interaction (SWBLI) and small scale structures broken down by the shear layer instability in the transition region, and shock-induced flow separation. The pressure coefficient, the root mean square (RMS) of fluctuating pressure and streamwise range of shock wave oscillation agree well with experimental data. The results demonstrate the capability of the WRILES method for predicting the buffet phenomena at high Reynolds numbers. }
